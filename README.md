# bash-pentesting-tools
## Suite of bash scripts for simplification of CTFs/pentesting

### Installation:
```
$ ./install.sh <username>
```
Required dotfiles will be copied to your $HOME directory
binary files/completions will be copied to corresponding directories

### How it works
Scripts work by storing environment variables like $target or $port 
in dotfiles with a set of scripts for easy change of their values, 
which guaranties that your variables will not be erased with new 
terminal instance you create.

### Usage examples
```
$ _target_pivot 64.233.164.102
```
\_target_pivot change IPv4 values of several $target variables

```
$ _options 
 $eth0_ip: 127.0.0.1
 $eth0_gateway: 127.0.0.1
 
 Ports:
 $port: 1337
 $port1: 3306
 
 Targets:
 $target: 64.233.164.102  status: UP
 $target1: 999.999.999.999  status: DOWN
```
\_options show useful information about available targets/their states
network gateways/your machine ip in different networks

These variables can be also used in any sort of bash scripts how they 
are used in \_help script which is also included into suite. 
```
$ _help ftp
    â”Œ Connect to target
 1. ftp -i 64.233.164.102 21
 2. Basic ftp commands
 State your choice: 1
$ ftp -i 64.233.164.102 21
```
Here $target variable is substituted by its corresponding value

Highly suggest you making your bash self-updating in case of change
of environment variables which are specified in dotfiles
