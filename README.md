# bash-pentesting-suite
## Suite of bash scripts for simplification of CTFs/pentesting

### Installation:
```
$ ./install.sh <username>
```
Required dotfiles will be copied to your $HOME directory binary files 
as well as completions will be copied to corresponding directories.

### How it works
Scripts work by storing IPv4 addresses of your penetration testing target in 
$target environment variable and save it in dotfiles.
You can change values of those variables with a set of binaries which parse 
the dotfile and change their values directly.
That guaranties that your variables will not be erased with new terminal 
instance you create.
Main aim of this suite is to save time and speed up process for capture 
the flag enthusiasts.

### Usage examples
_target_pivot changes IPv4 values of several $target variables:
```
$ _target_pivot 64.233.164.102
```

_port_pivot works the same as \_target_pivot but saves port values:
```
$ _port_pivot 1337
```

_options show useful information about available targets/their states/network gateways/your machine ip in different networks:
```
$ _options 
$eth0_ip: 127.0.0.1
$eth0_gateway: 127.0.0.1

Ports:
$port: 1337
$port1: 3306

Targets:
$target: 64.233.164.102  status: UP
$target1: 999.999.999.999  status: DOWN
```
These variables can be also used in any sort of bash scripts since they 
are exported. They are being used like that in _help script which is 
also included into this suite:
```
$ _help ftp
   â”Œ Connect to target
1. ftp -i 64.233.164.102 21
2. Basic ftp commands
State your choice: 1
$ ftp -i 64.233.164.102 21
```
Here $target variable is substituted by its corresponding value which 
optimizes your work.

Highly suggest you making your bash self-updating in case of change
of environment variables which are specified in dotfiles. Planning to add this feature here in future updates.
